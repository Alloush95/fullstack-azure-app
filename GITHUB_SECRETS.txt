```

### 2. AZURE_TENANT_ID

```

### 3. AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID

## What's Been Configured

✅ Service Principal created: `github-fullstack-app-sp`
✅ Contributor role assigned to resource group `rg-fullstack-app`
✅ Federated credential configured for OIDC authentication
✅ AcrPush role granted for Azure Container Registry

## Next Steps

1. Add the three secrets above to your GitHub repository
2. Commit and push your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add mock data and update CI/CD"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Watch your deployment at:
   https://github.com/Alloush95/fullstack-azure-app/actions

4. After deployment completes, your app will be live with the new mock data!

## Important Notes

- Using OIDC federated credentials (more secure than client secrets)
- No secrets are stored in the workflow file
- Automatic deployment on every push to `main` branch
- Docker images are cached for faster builds
